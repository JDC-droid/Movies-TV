        <p>Well it all started when I was just a young warthoooog...Lion king...Anyway, the playstation has been my main source for
           fueling this hobby as the next paragraph's will tell.
        </p><br>
        <p>As of late I do still game quite a lot of my free time due to having friends from different
           areas in the world including the main gaming group which of most consists of me and 8 people residing in the United States.
        </p><br>
        <p>We play nearly everyday and my gaming library is filled to the brim of all different genres 
          that we all enjoy to play solo or as a group and it only ever expands and expands.

        <p>The Xbox consoles have been not as prominent as the playstation's for me
           although they were still very important in this hobby.
        </p><br>
        <p>Most time I ever turn my Xbox on is to ever play games exclusive to that console 
          but in the past it was my main console for the longest time for 
          example I would get home everyday form school and play Black Ops 2 everyday.

        <p>Nintendo is the least I've played however I have still 
          had many of their consoles to also boost my hobby.
        </p><br>
        <p>My first Nintendo console was the Gameboy (the silver one before the Gameboy Color)
           to where I recently bought one last year again for nostalgia, on my Nintendo 
           consoles I usually play a small range from, a few Super Mario, Legend of Zelda, Animal crossing, Pokemon 
           and a few other games here and there.
